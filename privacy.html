  <p>Effective Date: August 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Viba (“the App”), by Axora Labs, values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it, in compliance with GDPR and other applicable laws.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
